"""Copy this file into your
submissions/<your-name>/usecase-2-production-incident-investigator/ folder
and implement investigate(). See ../README.md for the full brief.

Required interface - do not change the signature:

    def investigate(query: str, corpus: dict) -> dict:
        # corpus: filename -> full document text, e.g.
        #   {"logs.md": "...", "architecture.md": "...", "api_specs.md": "...",
        #    "deployment_history.md": "...", "previous_incidents.md": "...",
        #    "runbooks.md": "...", "known_issues.csv": "..."}
        # Not every value is markdown prose - known_issues is a raw CSV
        # catalog (multiple rows, most of them irrelevant to any given
        # incident). Treat every corpus value as plain text either way.
        ...

Return a dict with exactly these keys:
    "root_cause"          str, non-empty
    "supporting_evidence" list[dict], each {"source": <filename>, "excerpt": <str>}
    "impacted_systems"    list[str]
    "mttr_minutes"        int | None
    "remediation"         str
    "confidence_score"    float, 0-100
    "needs_human_review"  bool - MUST equal (confidence_score < 50)

Nothing is scaffolded here - you're building the full pipeline, both
halves of "RAG":

1. Ingest + retrieve. Turn `corpus` into something you can rank against
   `query` (bag-of-words overlap, TF-IDF, or whatever you choose - pick
   your own vectorization/similarity approach), and produce a relevance
   ranking over the documents. Remember known_issues.csv is row-oriented,
   not prose - decide whether to treat it as one blob or split it into
   per-row candidates.
2. Correlate across documents. A confident conclusion here isn't "the
   top-ranked document says X" - it's "logs, deployment history, known
   issues, the runbook, and a previous incident all point at the same
   thing." Count how many *distinct source types* actually corroborate
   your leading hypothesis.
3. Calibrate confidence_score from that corroboration count, not from how
   relevant the top document felt. A single weak signal with no
   deployment correlation, no known-issue match, and no precedent should
   score low - and reporting a confident-sounding root cause anyway when
   the evidence doesn't support it is worse than correctly saying "I'm
   not sure."
4. Extract mttr_minutes and impacted component names from the retrieved
   text (a runbook's "Typical MTTR: N minutes" line, an architecture
   doc's component name) - simple pattern matching is fine, you don't
   need anything fancier.
